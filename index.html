          <h2>Correlations Discovered Between Poverty and Healtcare</h2>
          <p>Using the <a href="https://factfinder.census.gov/faces/nav/jsf/pages/searchresults.xhtml">
            2014 ACS 1-year estimates</a>, I analyzed the relationship between the poverty rates
            in the U.S., and the percentage of the state population which has healtcare.</p>

          <p>It appears that states with higher rates of poverty also have a 
            higher percentage of households which lack healthcare. For example, the state of 
            Texas has a poverty rate of about 17%, and more than 24% of the population
            do not have access to healthcare. Meanwhile, states with lower rates of poverty have a smaller percentage of their population
            without healtcare. For example, Massachusetts has a poverty rate of about 11.5%, and less than 
            6% of their population lacks healthcare. </p>

          <p>Another interesting insight is that states with the highest levels of poverty 
            are located in the south, such as Mississippi, New Mexico, Alabama, and Louisiana. 
            The states with the lowest levels of poverty are located in the North, such as New Hampshire, 
            Maryland, and Connecticut. It's possible that the differences in population density could 
            contribute to the challenges Southern states face with regards to poverty and healthcare.</p>
